1029,"Throwaway for personal reasons 

So me and my husband had a fight . It started because he asked me if he should recommend tinder to his single friend . I said “oh do you like tinder?” And the fight kind of started like that . He said he doesn’t use tinder and I said “if I ever found out you were using tinder I’d be suicidal” 

To which he responded “saying things like that makes you less attractive” 

I responded “you’re not attractive either” something like that 

We fought , I took a shower , we made up , then we went to our friend’s house for a bit

Now I’m feeling very insecure 

I feel like he’s going to leave me or cheat on me , which in turn , makes me want to cheat on him 

I’m so afraid 

He’s sitting in the other room right now and I’m just on my phone in the living room typing this 

I told him “I feel like you’re going to cheat on me” 

And he responded “don’t say that , it breaks my heart” 

I’m not sure what to do 

TDLR; husband and I got in a fight , I’m feeling so insecure and feel like I want to cheat and try to leave him , but I do love him very much , why do I feel this way ?",My wife and I are currently fighting and I was about to sleep on the couch. You sound so toxic that I’m heading up to bed right now for snuggles. Thank you for putting my problems into perspective.,relationship,0.0,0,1,0.0
2022,"Any advice on long distance relationships? I just started a long distance relationship. We both love each other and are up to the task but that does not change the fact that it will be a difficult experience, at least until we are actually abre to move in together in the future.  


any tips, dos and don'ts or tricks to make the distance a little less unbearable? we will probably be able to see each other once or twice a year.","Communication. Even if it feels like you are over explaining, or over emoting, because context online/ over the phone is hard. 

Set expectations of how much time you will put aside for each other. Life still marches on and there are times when you will both have to march with it. 

Have dates. Prep a special meal together and eat it together online. Watch a movie together online. 

Start saving money together. Decide how much you both can set aside per month and do that. You didn't say what how far the distance was, but eventually you will need a place to live and other expenses that are tied to moving.

444,"Background my husband 31M has almost died twice in the last 5 years from his autoimmune disease as a result his mental health has declined. I was pregnant with our daughter the first time and have done everything I can to get him mental health support since the first time as I watched his mental health decline I have taken him to appointments, gone in with him, let him go in without me (depending on what he requested), supported him through multiple medication which didn't work, spent countless hours discussing his wants, needs and struggles. Anything he needed I was there whist also figuring out how to be a mum, working, sorting daycare and doctors and running the house with basically no support from him which I accepted because I knew he was in a bad place. 

Early 2020 he changed jobs because of covid, autoimmune disorders and working with the public in a pandemic big no no so he switched to something that he had always wanted to do even though he knew he would be home less and more would be on me and I 100% supported this decision and did everything in my power to make his life as easy as possible. Late 2020 he tells me that he wants another baby. We had agreed that our daughter was going to be our only child and I was not prepared to have another baby but I told him I needed some time to come to terms with the idea and then I'm sure we could figure something out. He asks me to go off my contraception so my hormones have time to chill before I get pregnant which I agree to under the stipulation that he was careful. The first time we did anything after I had my contraception removed after being reminded multiple times throughout the act that I was not ready for a baby yet he made no attempt to be careful. I was utterly devastated and spent the rest of the month to shocked to do anything. End of the month came and guess what I'm pregnant. The day I find out he withdraws all support from me anything I had left is gone. No shoulder to cry on, he wouldn't even talk to me about how I was feeling and just took it as an attack on him. 

I am broken. When work finds out I break down and have to leave my shift because I am utterly devastated. I can't function or think. 

Finally about half way through my pregnancy I completely break and have a full blown breakdown that almost cost me and my son our lives. He spent the entire time at a mates place with our daughter and only called for help when he noticed I had cut the seat belt out of my car and taken all my meds with me. I spend 4 days in hospital and my husband and I discussed how things had gotten to that point and how we were going to improve things in the future. 

I get out of hospital and the next day my husband disappears on me to his mates place which I later find out is because he met a 19 year old there when I had my break down and is hanging with her. That night he sleeps with her then proceeds to do a 180 flip on who he had been for our entire relationship turning his back on our daughter spending all his time with this teenager whist telling me he only saw her a couple of times, being disrespectful to me and continuing to lie, cheat and worse. The whole time I knew I could feel it. I could feel that he was lying to me. Eventually one night I know he is lying to me after 5 weeks and I ring the girl and fill her in on what's been happening in our house things like that we were still sleeping together and he was telling me he wanted to be with me and she was the worst mistake of his life. She is shocked but young and still wants to be with my husband. He takes off and sits on his own for ages before eventually ending up at her place for one last go before coming home to me and saying he wanted to fix things and start over and breaking up with her. I said no. There is no housing in this area so we still live together and for the last almost year he has been no where but work, shops and home to try and show me that he is serious. He is back to treating me and our family with respect he is following up on his mental health of his own accord, he worked really hard on forming a bond with our son because they just weren't connected like he was with my daughter, he supported me through labour and delivery ( only one person in the room because of covid and I respect that he is the children's parent), he wants to make some form of a relationship work in the future and completely understands that what happened was beyond unacceptable. 

I feel that even if we got back together eventually our vows were broken so the marriage is void and I don't want to stay in a marriage for the possibility of getting back together one day. I will never trust him and as I have explained to him the lid is on the box of  my emotions because it's to painful to feel them (PTSD response from my younger years) he is trying everyday and he has respected that I will not even accept a slightly raised voice or wrong word without asking him to leave at least to think about what he has done and come back to me with a coping strategy to ensure it doesn't happen again. I won't accept that behaviour in my house from our 4 year old so why would I accept it from him. Over the years I'm sure it would probably be easier with the children to be in some form of mutually respectful relationship but I don't see that having a marriage certificate contributes to that and I also know that if he loves me and I am incapable of feeling anything for him that is eventually going to mess with him and our children's view of a normal relationship. I know I should probably eventually learn how to take the lids off the feelings boxes but I'm not there yet. 

So today we can legally get divorced and I was like yep let's do this which I have been saying for the last year and he turns around and says do we have to I really thought you might change your mind or at least put it off for a bit to figure out where we end up. 

Honestly just any comments on this whole messed up situation and how to cope moving forward and any advice on if I should apply for divorce would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: husband has a breakdown as a response to mine turns into a deadbeat then works really hard on sorting his shit what do I do?Sorry I forgot to give context on who he was before. 

He was the man that planned our wedding because he could see that I was getting overwhelmed and wanted me to have the ultimate wedding without all the stress so he asked me what I dreamed of and then came to me with options that fit my dream he also said that it didn't matter to him as long as he got to marry me at the end of it. 

He was the man that saw me struggling with skin irritations to finally find a moisturiser that worked but it wasn't available online and the closest store was two hours away so he drove up to buy as much of it as he could get so I never had to deal with the pain and irritation again. 

He was the man that sat by my bed side when I lost my first two pregnancies and held me whist I cried for weeks even though he had his own grief 

He was the man that was always there when ever any challenge or obstacle was in my way to knock it down with me. 

He was my other half which is why after 5 years of being together and him literally having my back for every day of it I agreed to marry him. 

He taught me to drive when it terrified me and would stay up late on work nights so we could spend half an hour driving round when the streets were empty 

He would cook me dinner if I worked a late shift and come home on his lunch break to make me coffee and breakfast before I had to go to work 

He would wake me up with coffee and breakfast almost every day if he could 

I was his queen and he treated me like that. It started to change after the first time he almost died but got much worse after the second time. Until then he treated me with all the love in the world and our daughter was his princess she could never want for anything and he loved her beyond belief. 

I hope that helps with some insight on why I said 180 flip.","Divorce him.  Co-parent.

339,"I (23F) had a 4.5-year relationship with my ex (24M). We broke up recently last January and here's the story (sorry if it's quite long).

My ex-boyfriend is extremely loving and caring. He experienced depression a while back and was very suicidal until he met me. He told me I was the reason he wanted to live again. I appreciate that part a lot since I made a huge difference to one person. He made me feel that I don't have anything to fear from our relationship. One of the downsides he has, however, is that sometimes he is extremely wary and distrustful of people around me. He calls it his ""radar"" where he can detect threats to our relationship. Another downside he has is that he cannot continuously provide the attention and time I need because he's a careerman - he's so focused on furthering his career right now because according to him, he wants to build our future. I'm not saying he cannot provide, but I'm saying he lacks that part in loving me. I'm a very needy gal, to be honest.

Anyway, going back, a year and a half ago, I got employed on a tech company. I met new friends and colleagues because of this new job. I don't mind sharing with my ex the people I meet and I interact with and my day to day experience in the company. He didn't have a problem with these people until I was able to mention a guy, let's call him Gerald. Gerald is one of the supervisors in the company that I was hired in. He's a cool guy and all and he's in an 8-year long relationship. Here comes the first problem - ex doesn't like him because:

A. He feels he is the type to be attracted to me
B. He feels he is the type to find a way to get close to me

[EDIT: My ex was only this hostile against Gerald, not my other co-workers. He was fine with them.]

At first, I was like ""no, he isn't"" and my ex just kept a stern warning about dealing with Gerald. Fast forward to a few months, Gerald and I got close... Really close to each other to the point my ex got very, very angry and it caused our first breakup (we had 3). I admit, one lapse I had was I didn't mention to him that Gerald and I are getting close. As I said, I share everything to him - except Gerald and I. I was very fearful he might cause an issue or maybe cut off our friendship but I got really close to the guy.

September 2020 came and he found out about us. We basically broke up and I begged for him to come back. He said yes but on the condition I cut ties with Gerald and I just maintain a civil professional relationship with him since he's a workmate. I promised him that and then went along our merry way.

Fast forward to October 2021 - Gerald sought my help with picking an engagement ring for his long-term GF. It started with a few discussions and then we eventually rekindled our friendship from a while back. I don't feel anything towards him except appreciation because he's a friend, he's there, he's very open to me, he has the initiative to update me and bothers to ask me how I am every now and then. It's something I like from a person. Eventually, we went and decided a pet name or endearment for each other- ""baby"" - which is also what I called my ex. Also, we reached the point if exchanging ""I love yous"" but it was not romantic. Just plain appreciation for the friendship. However, Gerald admitted that he was attracted to me and that he liked me at some point in our friendship.

Unfortunately, January 2022 came and my ex was basically scrolling my phone and found out about our conversations. He confronted me about it and I was scared shitless because of what he found out. I was doing my best to keep it hidden from him because I know I would lose him. When he asked me about it - I lied three times but I knew he wouldn't fall for it. I admitted defeat and told him about it. I just explained to him that there's nothing going on between us and the baby and Iloveyous are just nothing.

He didn't buy it and broke up with me saying I didn't respect him, that I technically cheated on him, that I shouldn't have hid it if there was no malice behind it, and that he felt so betrayed and so small because why can't I chose to just respect him and our relationship by not engaging with the guy he loathed/hated/felt threatened with. He keeps saying he wasn't enough for me. He kept saying I just basically threw away our four years by choosing to maintain the friendship with Gerald. I kept insisting nothing was going in between us romantically and that he should not insist that there was something going on between Gerald and I. And also I said that he didn't fail as a boyfriend.

Last time we were together was the breakup, he was crying because he told me he revolved his life around me... Which us true. He declined offers of jobs (which are better paying and all) from other states just because he knows I needed him to be near me. He always keeps me in his decision-making processes and that he always puts me in consideration in almost everything he does.

Right now, I'm here broken and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I'm the asshole because I didn't cheat on him. I just wanted a buddy - someone who can give me the care and attention I needed because he cannot provide it. I feel bad because he felt that way and that I wasted the life he planned for us.

I want to get him back... Was I the asshole? Was I wrong? Help me please.

TL;DR! My long-term bf broke up with me because I kept being friends with someone he hated/felt threatened. The guy he hates liked me at some point and we exchanged I love yous and called each other baby but for me it was just plain friendship. Ex-bf didn't buy it. I want him back because he loved me so much and I do, too.",I don’t buy the Gerald is just a friend thing either. He is attracted to you and was clearly a threat to your relationship. There is a reason he gives you the type of attention he does. You either know this or you are incredibly naive. Your ex was right.

I was able to step back from what they said, objectively ask myself if I agreed with that statement, and if I didn't, it ceased to bother me.

At the moment I put exactly half into savings straight away, then at the end of the month having less money in the account forces me to be a bit more frugal. But I find myself running out sometimes, and just transferring money over back from savings anyway, making it pointless.

Do you put it into savings first, or do you stick to your budget and then put the surplus into savings at the end?","Transferring money into your savings account as soon as you get paid is the better idea. ""Out of sight, out of mind"".

To solve the budgeting problem: next time you get paid, save a bit less than normal (say, $200 less). Keep the extra money in your current account as a buffer against unexpected expenses. The following month you can go back to saving your normal amount. If you need to use some of the ""buffer"" amount in a given month, you can top it up by saving less the following month.

1176,"We have been together for 4 years, and this is a heavy pattern of his. I've tried to talk to him many times, but at this point I think it will just continue.

I'm trying to decide if I need personal therapy to learn how to deal with it (I'm guessing the best way to deal with it is to calmly tell him the facts and then ignore the blame), or if WE need therapy together to address why he does this and how to deal with it when it comes up (it comes up a lot).

What happens currently is I end up getting angry and I'll argue with him and a big fight starts. That isn't working well so I need to figure out another strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years he's tried to blame me for a myriad of things. Recently he tried to blame me for losing a contract (he's self employed) because he says I don't help him enough. I do help him, but he  seems to think if I were his full-time assistant this could have been avoided (he wants me to work for him instead of working at my own job because he says we can be much more successful if we work together on the business). The issue is I did that previously and it didn't work well. He's very very difficult to work for. He has poor communication and often would assume I should figure things out that he needs without him ever telling me. It negatively affected our relationship and I told him it's best if I don't help him (to that degree) with work. I told him to simply hire someone else. Then when he's difficult, it may affect their working relationship but it won't be affecting our personal relationship. He doesn't agree at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Things came to a boiling point over the weekend because he once again tried blaming me for something I had nothing to do with. We were having a nice evening, and then suddenly he receives an email and he's all upset and stressed out and claiming it's my fault (he thought a work contact knew something private about his life that he didn't want work people to know -- in the end, they didn't, he had simply jumped to conclusions -- and he thought they knew this because I had friended them on social media because we are acquaintances...I most certainly did not). I kept telling him that I am not friends online with this person and he just kept saying ""yes you are!"" It's like talking to an illogical person when he gets like that.

&amp;#x200B;

He got it all straightened out, but he didn't apologize for shouting at me and accusing me and trying to blame me. When I was still annoyed with him, he became annoyed with me...telling me to stop holding onto anger and escalating him when he's stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a simple thing and no big deal in the end. But I kept thinking about how it kind of ruined my evening. We had been having a nice quiet evening, and out of the blue I'm being shouted at and accused of something stupid and not believed. This happens WAY too much, and it raises my adrenaline and gets me all stressed out. Meanwhile as soon as he gets it straightened out, he's all happy and back to normal and thinks I'm holding grudges and ""keeping the fight going"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I've come here to ask for opinions on which strategy to take. Do I get myself therapy since I'm kind of doubtful he's going to change this clearly deeply ingrained pattern of blaming others? I love him and so maybe I can just learn to ignore it. So far I haven't because it enrages me to be blamed for ridiculous things (and it's not always ""just in the moment""....some things he will insist forever that I am to blame for...such as the loss of this contract). Or is couple's therapy the way to go?

tldr: boyfriend has a tendency to blame me for things that are not my fault","No offense (because it's obvious you care about him) but he clearly has not grown up enough to take responsibility for any of his issues.

If anything goes wrong, he will 100% blame you and you need to ask yourself whether this is something you want to put up and shut up with or not.

Where has this item gone - looks like I did it.
Where have you been - I've been somewhere genuine but I look guilty.  

This shit is taking over my life.","Practice. Do shit worth being guilty over. I became a good liar through practice. There are of course other ways to practice. 

For instance:  The other day I was having a conversation at work about some topic, I forget what, but somebody overheard me and said ""wait, you're leaving the store? Where are you going?"" 

I had no idea what she was talking about, and I assumed that she must have misheard me. Seeing the opportunity, I immediately switched gears and said, ""Yeah, I thought I had already told you... My last day is tomorrow."" 

In that moment, I tried to sell my honesty. I tried to imagine what it would feel like to be giving her that news. Excited to tell her, but sad that she had to find out this way. A little bit guilty that I didn't tell her sooner. Obviously its difficult to convey these emotions fully consciously, but taking a moment to mentally switch gears and get into the mindset of the person whom you wish to be is so critical to selling your 'truth'. 

Even though you aren't lying in this case, lying is based on lying to yourself. If you want to sell a dishonest emotion, sell it to yourself. Don't just start with a situation like that. Lie to total strangers about your name. What do you do for a living? Today you're a computer programmer, tomorrow, you're working retail. 

Get a little practice, and soon you will be able to more effectively control the unconscious responses that your body conveys in every interaction. Pay attention, and bluff whenever you can get some practice. I have had some really damn bad social anxiety all of my life. So I learned to lie.
